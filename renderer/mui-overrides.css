/*
Due to how imported .css files are inserted, by default you won't be able to
override any custom mui styles.
This example works because it's more specific
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity).
If you would like to override mui styles with imported .css files without the
extra class name, you can do something like:

    :root .MuiButton-root {
      color: #f0f;
    }
*/

.mui-overrides .MuiButton-root {
  color: #f0f;
}
